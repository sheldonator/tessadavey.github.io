Theresa Davey is an assistant professor at Tohoku University. She previously completed her PhD and worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Imperial College London, United Kingdom.

Her PhD research considered point defects in zirconium carbide, and lead to the development of a method to incorporate certain defect related properties, such as formation energies, in a CALPHAD description directly. She was awarded a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Early Career Scientists in 2019 to further explore CALPHAD modelling of structural point defects.

Her other current research at Tohoku University involves developing first principles only thermodynamic databases for alloy systems (primarily Ni-based), using a modified-CALPHAD approach using insight from other theoretical techniques. She has a strong interest in computational materials design and materials informatics.

She is passionate about equality and increasing the numbers of women working in the STEM field, and is involved with diversity efforts in several professional societies.
