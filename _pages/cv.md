Education
======
* MSci in Physics with Theoretical Physics, Department of Physics, Imperial College London, 2012
* MSc in Shock Physics, Department of Physics, Imperial College London, 2013
* PhD in Materials Science, Department of Materials, Imperial College London, 2017

Work experience
======
* July 2017 - present: Assistant Professor
  * Tohoku University, Japan
  * Working with Prof. Ying Chen and Prof. Hideo Miura at the Fracture and Reliability Research Institute within the School of Engineering, in collaboration with Prof. Tetsuo Mohri at the Institute for Materials Research at Tohoku University, as part of the Post-K supercomputer project.
  * Awarded (PI) Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Early Career Researchers 19K15273 (2019-2021), "Developing models for CALPHAD-type phase diagrams that directly consider the effect of structural point defects".

* March 2017 - July 2017: Postdoctoral Research Associate
  * Imperial College London, UK
  * Working with Professor Mike Finnis in a project on the theory and calculation of thermophysical properties of Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs). Developing methods to improve the use of first principles calculations of defect properties in the assessment of thermodynamic databases, combining the CALPHAD method with DFT calculations.

* October 2015 - December 2016: Graduate Teaching Assistant
  * University of California Berkeley, USA
  * Working as a calculus tutor for first year undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, spending a semester abroad in London. Students are enrolled at ACCENT College in London, where they receive calculus lectures once a week, complemented by drop in tutoring sessions.

* October 2015 - April 2017: Graduate Teaching Assistant
  * Department of Materials, Imperial College London, UK
  * Giving tutorials, assigning problems, assisting in problem classes, and marking coursework for undergraduates and master's students within the Department of Materials. Courses taught have been MSE101 (Mathematics and Computing), MSE103 (Mechanical Behaviour), MSE104 (Microstructure and Properties), MSE201 (Mathematics and Computing), and MSE317 (Modelling of Materials Processing and Performance)
